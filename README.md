# Webots Autonomous Intersection Crossing
 <sup>*Undergraduate  project for Mechatronics course (2021).*</sup>


 ## Project Objectives
In this project, our group was tasked to design and code a basic strategy for autonomous intersection crossing between two or more robots at a two-lane non-signalized ‘T’ intersection.


## Program Functionality
In Webots, we designed a basic vehicle equipped with distance sensors, a radio receiver/emitter, a GPS and LED lights to interface with the controller. The autonomous vehicle program is decentralized, therefore each vehicle runs its own instance of the Python program.

The robot controller program has the following features:
- lane following;
- obstacle avoidance;
- inter-robot communication;
- intersection crossing coordination.
